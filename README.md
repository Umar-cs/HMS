# Hotel Management System
The "Console-based Hotel Management System" is a software project aimed at aiding hotel owners in efficiently managing room reservations, records, and generating regular reports. The project is designed to handle a hotel with 5 floors, each having 50 rooms. It offers various room types, including Standard, Moderate, Superior, Junior Suite, and Suite, each with its own pricing and features.

The system records comprehensive customer information, such as full name, age, gender, ID card number, balance, reservation details, floor number, room type, room number, check-in and checkout times, and remaining stay duration. Customers can be categorized as new or returning, and appropriate actions are taken based on their status.

The key functionalities of the system include:
1. **Reservation Management**: The system prevents double booking by ensuring a room cannot be reserved twice until the customer checks out or their reservation time expires.
2. **Customer Classification**: The system identifies customers as new or returning and manages their information accordingly.
3. **Daily Reports**: The system generates detailed daily reports, presenting data like check-ins, checkouts, reserved and vacant rooms, and room types.

To ensure data persistence, the system saves all information in files, with no specific file format requirement. This project streamlines hotel operations by automating reservation processes, tracking customer data, and producing insightful reports, contributing to effective hotel management and customer satisfaction.
